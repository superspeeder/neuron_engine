# Neuron Editor

This crate is the editor application. This is responsible for creating, editing, building, and packaging projects.

In the future, this will include a CLI mode which allows for automated building and packaging of projects (primarily for
CI purposes. This mode will not use any of the graphics things)

This editor is built using the engine itself (but not any of the fancy runtime or packaging features, simply as
statically linked to the engine).
